# 👕 ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

**ReWear** is a web-based platform that empowers communities to reduce textile waste and promote sustainable fashion. It allows users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Every year, millions of tons of wearable clothes are discarded, contributing to pollution and unnecessary waste. Many of these garments are still in good condition and could benefit others if exchanged properly. However, there is a lack of accessible, community-driven platforms that make clothing exchange simple, rewarding, and trustworthy.

**ReWear** addresses this by creating a platform where people can list, browse, and swap clothes either through direct exchange or using a point-based system. It fosters a circular fashion economy while encouraging environmentally conscious behavior.
